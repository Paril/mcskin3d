1.5:
?- Clear skin option
?- Handle more upload errors
?- Selection tool, copy/paste
?- Layers
?- Tutorial system
?- Don't rely on OpenGL to store finalized image
?- Mouse shortcuts / "multitool"
?- Fit keyboard shortcuts into tooltips
?- Smudge tool
?- Plugin system
?- Double-check language strings, ensure all English strings in source are language-ized
?- Ability to move the model around as well (change center)
?- Automated saving?
?- Make sure people are aware that new skins are added (select them, etc)
?- Ability to see resolution/model from the treeview
?- Colorize

1.4.1:
*- Fix Techne model support (swapped box position and rotate position by accident)
*- Splash screen
	- Needs an image.
?- Error reporter protocol 2
	- Use binary rather than ASCII transfer
	- GZip (or LZMA?) the data for space
	- More precise information (raw exception data, etc)
	- Improvements to server program
?- News feed using RSS
?- Still getting fill bucket errors...

1.4:
*- Error reporting service
*- Better versioning system (minor/build as well)
	*-- Update program
*- Custom model support
	?-- All models supported by 1.2.5+ included
*- Custom brushes
*- Deleting all skins (folders, etC) causes errors.
*- Drag-drop from program to folder
*- Pick up on external file changes (this might be really tough to do in a non-Windows environment)
	-- NOTE: DISABLED, RE-CODE
*- Depth-sort alpha
	-- NOTE: per face? D:
*- Make 1x1 the default brush
*- Check upload size (apparently is broken)
*- Hex issues (more than 10 symbols = crash)
*- Fully dynamic overlay generation
	*-- Find a proper way of text'ing the top corners of each overlay
	*-- Line/Text Color
*- Change colorsquare/saturation slider to something better.
*- Allow "old-style" drag/drop in case the COM entry for drag/drop is missing.
*- Allow change to main skin directory (hold multiple directories as well?)
*- Reset camera button.
*- Multi-monitor support
*- Optimized color class
	-- Probably not as optimized as I'd like, but, it works.
*- Swatch editor
*- Cleanup moar
*- Consider interface changes
*- Dynamic detection of transparency of parts
*- New part system
/- Figure out what the stupid issue is with the stupid GL control being slower when the stupid cursor is over it.
/- Mineshafter support
/- Lighting options
/- Add other "common" color formats (CMYK, etc)
/- Automatic compilation of skin overlays
	-- Replaced with Dynamic Overlay system.
/- Posing
/- Fix smooth brushes
/- Automatically hide/show helmet based on transparency contained in helmet
	-- This will probably be included with automatic transparency detection

1.3:
?- Hopefully, get an optimized color class (not super-high priority)
*- Verify all undo buffers
*- Secondary color
*- Merge Dodge and Burn into one tool
*- Darken/Lighten tool
*- Tool options (perhaps expandable panel below the toolbar?)
*- Finish the treeview
*- Add "Overlays" folder, customizable background image
*- Hidden part "ghosting"
*- Modifyable Brush Size for pencil/eraser/dodge/burn/darken/lighten, exposure for Dodge/Burn/Darken/Lighten, "feather" for pencil/eraser/dodge/burn/darken/lighten.
*- Noise tool
*- Circle brushes
*- Part lock for fill bucket/noise tool
\- Feathering on brushes
\- Grid for 2d view?
\- Find a better way to do the tool options
